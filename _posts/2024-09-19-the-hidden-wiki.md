title: "The Hidden Wiki is pretty cool"

I've always been a bit on and off with the dark web. It's a curious place, and I'm a curious person who's often tempted by mysteries like that. However, as the saying goes, curioisty kills the cat, and I've seen stuff there that's put me off at times. That's not to say the dark web is evil. In fact, I want to make clear it's the polar opposite. The dark web is a excellent place to satisfy those thoughts of curiosity, achieve anonymity, amongst many other things, and The Hidden Wiki is an excellent place to start. The front page of the wiki is a link list, basically being a gateway into the dark web, being able to view other sites as well with similar content. Browsing further into the wiki, you get people talking about different interests, and tutorials on fitness, privacy, and so many other things. I think it's a pretty cool place that you should consider taking a look at.
