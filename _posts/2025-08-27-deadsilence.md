...yeah

Truthfully, I haven't had much of a presence publically until recently with my new Twitter account. Surprise to say, that post I made at 13 was totally wrong, Twitter is still well alive and kicking with different communities, although it has been overwhelmed with racism and far-right propaganda, spreaded by the owner of the site.

This is not a post about Twitter however, this is about me and this site, so let's talk about me and this site.

Truthfully, I've been doing mostly alright. I'm kind of a mess, and we won't go into description about that, but I've been great. Went camping, had some decent fish and chips up in Wales, and the sorts. The real story is that I've been burned out. SO burned out. For 6 months straight whenever I opened a code editor, I started dead into the screen and I physically couldn't bring myself to type. Eventually, I'd just alt-tab out into doomscrolling or watching a Youtube video. 

So what remains?
Well, I'm hoping to make a comeback. Write some tools properly, publish it out here, and start writing frequent updates. If you've bothered to check my Github, you might've noticed the good ol' OSA page I'm working on. Frankly, I think this law has been done intentionally to limit our freedoms under the guise of "think of the children!", but that opinion won't make it into the page. I'll focus on the facts there. 

But yeah, here we are.
Also, peep the name :P gone with Ender and Crazycat, it's Hail for good now.
