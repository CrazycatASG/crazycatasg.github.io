# I'm going to be honest with you.
This was meant to be a really short post. Like, really, really short. Originally, it was just 5 lines introducing myself and my intentions with this blog. But that's changed now. See, I've always had this burning passion for the web, ever since I was little. I'm not sure what facinated me about it, perhaps it was the wide range of material, maybe it was simply how all of this was created by connecting a bunch of computers together with a protocol. But either way, that doesn't matter now. The point is, I've wanted my own little space here on the web for a while. GitHub Pages offered me a way to do that, simply by placing a few HTML files here. But even so, I thought I could do something else. Turns out, you can use workflows to make GitHub Pages use the latest version of Jekyll (the tool gh pages uses), which is pretty useful for me, because that's exactly what I was using locally on my PC. Perfect! Thus, that brings us here. I'll reintroduce myself. Hi there, I'm Crazycat. This is my place on the internet. And hopefully, you can enjoy it too :)
