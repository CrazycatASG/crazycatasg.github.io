As I write this article, I'm learning how to use the web framework, Django. It's one of the most popular ones out there, even the big boys like Spotify, Instagram, and Dropbox use it. Simultaneously however, I'm trying to learn JavaScript, the language which pretty much makes the web go around. Everywhere you go, from Google, to a random cooking site, heck even this blog uses JavaScript. It's completely unavoidable in the age of the internet (unless you're using an extension like [NoScript](https://noscript.net/), and to be a professional web developer, you must have mastered the language. And then you check out someone like [100Rabbits](https://100r.co/), study them for a little while, then realize their website uses almost no JavaScript. What gives? Turns out, they're using C89, one of the oldest and most reliable languages out there. The fuck?
